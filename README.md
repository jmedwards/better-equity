# Better Equity 

This is the repository for the [Better Equity](http://better-equity.recursion.org/) website. It is hosted by GitHub Pages, which is why the default branch is gh-pages. The goal of this site is to highlight companies that allow employees longer than the typical 90 days to exercise their vested stock options.

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. In order to be listed, a company must report publicly in some medium (e.g., a tweet or post on Hacker News or Quora by a founder counts) that it offers an extended exercise window.

To add a company, add its details to the YAML frontmatter of the index.html page. Please keep the list alphabetical.
